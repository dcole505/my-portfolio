              Hello, my name is David. I currently reside in beautiful Portland, Oregon. I make my best effort to stay active in the community through volunteer work. It is my goal to make meaningful connections with people as we navigate this world <em>together</em>. These times are filled with uncertainty, but I believe that if we draw on one another for strength, we can perservere. My hope is that a career as a programmer will allow me to meet interesting people from all walks of life, and create interesting projects, we can be proud of.

              Originally from Santa Fe, New Mexico, I relocated to the northwest in 2010. For many years, I have worked in the service industry as a bar manager. Doing so has allowed me to improve my social skills and helped me adopt valuable management techniques, which will aid me in a new career. In 2017 I completed my associates degree in CIS at Portland Community College. I am now actively furthering my education in the Epicodus full-time web development track.
