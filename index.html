          My name is David and I currently reside in the majestic city of Portland, Oregon. Originally from Santa Fe, New Mexico, I relocated in 2010. For many years I worked in the service industry as a bar manager. I've been interested in changing careers and entering the technology field for a long time. This year, I finally took the first step in realizing that dream by enrolling at Epicodus! I'm very excited to challenge myself to learn and succeed.
